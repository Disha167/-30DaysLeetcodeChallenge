//ðŸŽ¯DAY 56 PROBLEM 1
//In this, we have to print the first node from right at each level, it can be done by level order traversal simply by storing the last node at each traversal or by 
//recurse traversal, by first going to right of tree, then left and storing the first node we come across at each level in ans vector. We maintain a variable for
//checking at which level we are currently.
