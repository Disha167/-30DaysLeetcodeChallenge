//ðŸŽ¯DAY 79 PROBLEM 1
/* Here, we have to find the edge that we can remove from the graph to make it uncycled from cycled, so first thing to notice is:
It can be any edge from cycle, if any edge from cycle is removed it becomes a non-cyclic graph.
But here, in this question we need to return the first occuring edge in edges vector from end so the approach here is to insert all the nodes in cycle in 
an unordered set and then traverse through the edges vector to find first such edge from end whose both nodes are in cycle set and that is our answer.

First, we create a graph(adjacency list) out of edges vector given, then we run dfs on 1 to get all edges in cycle. For that, once we first encounter an
already visited node ,we mark it as the start of the cycle and then returning back we push all the nodes untill we come across that start of cycle again,
that means our loop is completed we again mark it as -1 and do not push nodes further.
