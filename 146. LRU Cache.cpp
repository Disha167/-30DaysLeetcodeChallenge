//ðŸŽ¯DAY 59 PROBLEM 1
//In this, we use doubly linkedlist for maintaining the LRU cache, i.e. when we perform get or put on a node, it becomes most recently used so we delete the node
// at it's previous position (we find the previous position by using the map's key mp[key] gives the address of the node whose key is given to us) and then
//insert it after head as it is most recently used and then finally inserting it in the new position after head: to show that it is most recently used and using
//this current address to insert it into map again(deleting the previous address with same key earlier)
//Ease of deletion/insertion in doubly linked list is used here & ease of searching elements in map is used here
