//ðŸŽ¯DAY 71 PROBLEM 2
/*You can buy and sell as many times you want, so here PEAK-VALLEY CONCEPT comes to picture. You can both buy & sell at the same day, so you can buy & sell 
everytime the adjacent next price is greater than the present.

If you will make a graph for the prices like 1 7 8 10, then the differences between the consecutive numbers 7-1=6, 8-7=1, 10-8=2 all will sum up to 6+2+1=9=10-1
always so you can add the differences everytime.


The peak valley concept goes like this:
1
\       3   /5   
 \     /\  /
  \   /  \/
   \ /   4
    2
  HEIGHT (2,3)+HEIGHT(4,5)>=HEIGHT(2,5)
  
  There cant be a possible value of stocks where this is not true because how much the stocks will go down from 3 to 4, this much it will go up and extra will be 
  height(4,5)-height(3,4) so we have this diff extra in L.H.S , it can't be less .
