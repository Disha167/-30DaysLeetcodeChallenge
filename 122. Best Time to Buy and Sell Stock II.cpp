//ðŸŽ¯DAY 71 PROBLEM 2
/*You can buy and sell as many times you want, so here PEAK-VALLEY CONCEPT comes to picture. You can both buy & sell at the same day, so you can buy & sell 
everytime the adjacent next price is greater than the present.

If you will make a graph for the prices like 1 7 8 10, then the differences between the consecutive numbers 7-1=6, 8-7=1, 10-8=2 all will sum up to 6+2+1=9=10-1
always so you can add the differences everytime.
