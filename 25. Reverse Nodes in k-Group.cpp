//ðŸŽ¯DAY 81 PROBLEM 1
/*The approach is simple to reverse the k nodes and then everytime instead of connecting the tail to null, connect it to head of next linked list.
We can get the head of the next linked list by returning the prev when we are doing recursion and the tail of the linked list after recursion will be
the head of the linked list before recursion so that is stored in some variable and then recursion is called for next_ptr for next group of k nodes.
If the size of group is less than k, we dont have to do anything we just return the head of the next group with linked list order being as it is.
