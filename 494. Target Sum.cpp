//ðŸŽ¯DAY 52 PROBLEM 1
//The way of asking is different but it is the same problem as count the number of subsets with the given difference , here it is just asked in the way that before how many 
//elements we put- and before how many we put + but the problem is same. So, it reduces to subset sum problem just one very imp difference is that here the array element can
//be 0 as well
