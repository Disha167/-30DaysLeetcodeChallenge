//ðŸŽ¯DAY 84 PROBLEM 1
/*This is a problem of Multi-source BFS. The only difference between Single-source & Multi-source BFS is that here we push all the sources initially into 
the queue instead of only one source. So, here we have to find the nearest 0 from each cell, so the optimised approach is to call bfs from every zero
& maintain the matrix for updating the distance of all cells. THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS FIRST 1ST LEVEL OF ALL SOURCES ARE VISITED THEN 2ND LEVEL OF
ALL SOURCES & SO ON, so if a cell is reached from 2 zeros, then we are bound to reach by the nearest distance as smallest level is traversed first. So, we
need to visit every cell only once & can maintain a visited array. So, time complexity of Multi-source bfs is O(N*N), where N is no fo rows & coloums in
matrix as every cell is visited once only.
