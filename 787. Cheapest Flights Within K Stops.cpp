 //ðŸŽ¯DAY 36 PROBLEM 1
//This is a djikstra based problem just the additional constraint is of within k stops
//We make a adjacency matrix of vector of pair to push distance along with the source and then we use min heap that at every step is used to extract the minimum distance untill
//k becomes 0, as we are allowed to have maximum k stops only(i.e. why we make a heap of vectors to update the distance, source and no. of stops everytime). It works for every 
//test case as it follows the greedy approach of taking the least priced path everytime, hence overall giving the least price
