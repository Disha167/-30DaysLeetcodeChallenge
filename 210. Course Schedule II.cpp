//ðŸŽ¯DAY 61 PROBLEM 1
//It is a topological sort problem. Things to be noted is that it is mentioned in the question that there may not be a valid order i.e. when there is a cycle, so we first 
//have to check that whether there is a cycle in the graph or not and if there will be a cycle, then maybe the indegree of any vertex is not 0 and finally it does
//not go inside the while loop so we check at end that whether ans.size()==numCourses because if ans has less members that is the while loop ended before only and there
//is a cycle, so it will return an empty vector.
//If there is no cycle, the logic behind the kahn's algorithm is to count all the indegree of every vertices and if indegree is 0 , then push them in the queue, now if
//we push a particular vertice into the ans vector, all the dependencies related to it are removed, and simultaneously if the indegree becomes 0 i.e. all the 
//prerequisities are already taken, then we push it into the answer.

        //total no of courses.
