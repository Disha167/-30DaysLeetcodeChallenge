//ðŸŽ¯DAY 62 PROBLEM 1
//Painter partition type problem
//Binary search is applicable to this problem, as h is a monotonically decreasing function of k, i.e. as banana per hour eating speed k dereases, time taken i.e. h 
//increases whereas as k increases when h decreases.
//For binary search, we need a search space so low would be 0 i.e. speed can be minimum 0 (can't be negative) and high is sum of all bananas i.e. monkey can eat all
//bananas in 1 hr.
