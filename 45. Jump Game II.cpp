//ðŸŽ¯DAY 30 PROBLEM 1
//The simple approach is bfs approach, where we are creating levels, keeping track of max reachable at each level
/*Eg: 2 3 1 1 4, windows will be created and the key is to find the maximum reachable index from that window.
First window = 2, max reachable index = max(0+2,-1)=2 so 
Second window = 3 1 max reachable index = max(3+1,-1)=4 so l=1 r=2
Third window = 1 4 max reachable index = max(4+4, -1)=8 so r>n
The logic is from first window, we need one jump to reach second window, then one jump to reach 3rd window from 2nd window.*/

    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
         int l=0,r=0,min_jumps=0;

                max_index=max(max_index,i+nums[i]);

            }
            l=r+1;

            r=(max_index<n-1)?max_index:(n-1); /*corner case where max_index can be greater than n-1*/

//APPROACH 2





//Here, there is an assumption that always it will reach the last index so no need to check whether it will reach the last index or not.
/*THE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS PROBLEM IS THAT FOR EVERY INDEX WE CALCULATE MAX_REACHABLE INDEX WHILE TRAVERSING FROM THE CURRENT MAX_INDEX IT CAN REACH,(WE JUST KEEP
ON DECREASING THE STEPS)
BEFORE GOING TO NEXT LEVEL I.E. MAKING A JUMP(WHEN STEPS BECOMES 0), WE MAKE STEPS=MAX_REACHABLE-I I.E. EQUIVALENT TO MAKING A JUMP FROM MOST OPTIMAL INDEX
(This is the simple trick!!)*/

//We try to compress the solution in O(n), we take 2 pointers and traverse through the array iteratively from 1 to (n-1)th index(0 based indexing). For eg, if we 
//take the array 1 2 5 1 1 1 1 0 1 . The two pointers will be maxReachable i.e. the maximum index that can be reached from a particular position, NoOfSteps possible
//to take from the current position and one AnsJumps for storing the minimum number of jumps to reach last index. We have used the greedy approach i.e. we keep 
//track of the maximum reachable index from the given index and maximum reachable will not change unless we get a more optimal i.e. less number of jumps to reach 
//the last index . Eg. we do not update maxReach after encountering 5 in the above array as jumping from 5 will directly make us reach us 7th index instead of 
//jumping 4 times through the 1s. And on reaching 0, i becomes equal to maxreachindex so we return -1 as we cannot go further from 0 (not a part of this ques 
//although as here it supposes we always reach)

    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
