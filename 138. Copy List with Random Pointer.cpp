//ðŸŽ¯DAY 85 PROBLEM 1
/*Here we have to create a hard copy of brand new n nodes that has same numerical values as that of the previous list, and the new nodes should have same
same connection as that of previous list. 
THE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM IS to use a hashmap to map all the nodes with the newly created hard copies & then while traversing the linked list, make
mp[curr_node]->next=mp[curr_node->next] i.e. hardcopy of curr_node can be retreived by map & it's next will point to hardcopy of (curr_node's->next).
Similarly for random connection
& If we want to reduce the space complexity, then instead of using map to keep the reference of original node's hardcopy for all the nodes, we can use
the next pointer of original linked list and populate it with all hard copies & then use it for making the random & next connections similarly.
After making the connections, the links of original nodes to hard copy can be deleted to preserve the original list.
