//ðŸŽ¯DAY 22 PROBLEM 1
//It is based on the mathematical intuition of permutation i.e. if we have 3 positions and we have to permute for A,B,C then can place all three letters A,B,C on first position,
then after placing one letter on first position, we have a choice to choose between two letters for the second position, then ultimately we have to place the third letter on the 
//3rd position, we have no choices to choose from.
//The coding implementation of the above concept using recursion and backtracking is tough.

class Solution {
//HELPER FUNCTION
    void  genPermute(vector<int>&nums,int i, vector<vector<int>>&ans)
    //i is used to maintain the index of the letter which we are going to fix.
    //At, every level of decision tree, one additional letter is going to be fixed
    {
        if(i==nums.size()-1)
        {
            ans.push_back(nums);
            return;
        }
        //The following loop is required to iterate among the remaining letters that are not fixed
        for(int j=i;j<nums.size();j++)
        {
            swap(nums[i],nums[j]);
              genPermute(nums,i+1,ans);//At every level, we fix the next character. Here, we are passing i+1 as we are fixing ith character then calculating permutations
              //for i+1 to end of string. Eg: we fix A in first iteration(if string is ABC), and then we get 2 permutations ABC, ACB.
            swap(nums[i],nums[j]);//this statement is written to backtrack like if we swapped B with C in the 21st line to give ACB , then we have to swap again B and C
            //to get ABC back in order to perform the further permutation
        }
