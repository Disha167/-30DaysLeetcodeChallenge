//ðŸŽ¯DAY 83 PROBLEM 2
/* So, here you have to find the path having max sum, note that the path can also contain one node. So, on moving upward we return the lt+root as it can 
form a path ahead, similarly only root and rt+root. So, the rt and lt that we have at every step stores the max possible sum that can make the path
and can be extended. 
For considering the path, we have two choices either by including root or not including root.
But, at every step we have to also consider the path including the curr root, so at every step ans can be lt+curr_root->val,rt+curr_root->val,
lt+rt+curr_root->val, curr_root->val
