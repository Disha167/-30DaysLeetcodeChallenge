//ðŸŽ¯DAY 77 PROBLEM 1
/* This is a simple problem where we just have to keep track of freq and repeat the pattern inside the brackets that number of time. Eg : For input 2[a]g,
output will be aag. But, it might become a little trickier when we have a subproblem inside a problem for 2[s3[g]], answer would be sgggsggg.
So we use recursion as we have to solve all the subproblems in the same way as that of a problem, so a subproblem can be considered a problem in itself.
We just have to take care of updating the no_of_times and ans_string correctly as it will be different for every recursion call stack.
